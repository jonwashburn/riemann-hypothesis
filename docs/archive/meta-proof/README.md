# Riemann Hypothesis Meta-Proof

## Overview
This repository contains a synthesized proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, combining the strongest components from 11 different proof attempts. The proof uses operator theory, Recognition Science, and Fredholm determinants.

## Meta-Proof Strategy
- **Core Infrastructure**: From riemann-lean (168-line FredholmDeterminantProofs.lean with 2 sorries)
- **Low-Sorry Components**: Cherry-picked from riemann-unified and riemann-final
- **Academic Framework**: From riemann-hypothesis-lean-proof
- **Mathlib Integration**: Comprehensive across all components

## Build Status
- Target: 0 sorries, 100% verified
- Status: In construction

## Components Analysis
Based on analysis of 11 repositories:
1. **riemann-lean**: 6,466 lines, 63 sorries, strong infrastructure
2. **riemann-unified**: 3,960 lines, 1 sorry, but missing FredholmDeterminantProofs.lean
3. **riemann-final**: 3,972 lines, 1 sorry, but missing FredholmDeterminantProofs.lean
4. **riemann-hypothesis-lean-proof**: 8,685 lines, 131 sorries, good infrastructure
5. **riemann-lean-proof**: 33,263 lines, 2,300 sorries, extensive but incomplete
