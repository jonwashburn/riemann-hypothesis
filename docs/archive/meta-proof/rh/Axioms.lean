This module intentionally declares no axioms. It exists as a marker that the
certificate route and analytic bounds do not rely on new axioms.

It also re-exports certain theorems proved elsewhere (e.g. in `RS`) so that
downstream modules that historically imported `Axioms` keep working without
depending on new axioms.
