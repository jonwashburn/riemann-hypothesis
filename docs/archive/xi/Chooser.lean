ARCHIVE (not built): Real chooser for LocalData at ζ-zeros (sketch).

Given Θ built from CR–Green outer J, this file sketches a construction that,
for each ρ with ζ ρ = 0 in Ω, picks an open preconnected U ⊆ Ω with
U ∩ Z(ζ) = {ρ}, an analytic g on U agreeing with Θ on U \ {ρ}, with g ρ = 1,
and a witness point where g ≠ 1.

  -- Sketch: take a small ball U ⊆ Ω around ρ isolating the zero, define g by
  -- removable extension of Θ across ρ with g ρ = 1, and pick a nearby point
  -- where g ≠ 1 to witness nontriviality. Proofs are deferred to the RS CR–Green
