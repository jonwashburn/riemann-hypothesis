RS Θ and boundary/local assignment (archive sketch)

- Inputs:
  * Θ Schur on Ω \ Z(ζ)
  * For each boundary z with Re z = 1, choose U ⊆ Ω, removable set Z ⊆ Ω, and analytic g with g ρ = 1 s.t. Θ = g on U\Z and (U ∩ Z) = {ρ}.

- Goal:
  Provide `assign` matching the shape expected by RH.RS.ZetaSchurDecomposition / LocalPinchDataZOff.

- Outcome:
  `ZetaNoZerosOnRe1_from_offZerosAssignment` yields ζ ≠ 0 on Re = 1; together with off-zeros data this yields ζ ≠ 0 on Ω; then via factorization and ξ-symmetry, RH for ξ follows.

Implementation note:
- This remains at the statement level until explicit Θ, N, and local removable data are supplied; later move into rh/RS once finished.
