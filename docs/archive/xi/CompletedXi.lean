ARCHIVE (not built): Completed ξ formalization sketch.

This file is a staging area to formalize the completed Riemann ξ function:
  ξ(s) = (1/2)·s·(1−s)·π^{−s/2}·Γ(s/2)·ζ(s)

Once complete and reviewed, move the content into `rh/academic_framework/` and
wire into the route.

/-- Skeleton: G(s) is nonzero on the open right half-plane Ω.
    Note: requires careful handling near s = 1 where ζ has a pole and the
    completed ξ cancels; the factor G alone may vanish at 0/1 but the product
    ξ is entire. This lemma will be refined or replaced in the final factoring
    argument to avoid relying on G ≠ 0 pointwise at s = 1. -/

  -- TODO: use that Γ has no zeros, π ≠ 0, and restrict to a domain avoiding 0,1.
  -- Alternatively, avoid this lemma in the final route and argue directly with ξ.
