ARCHIVE (not built): Completed ξ formalization sketch.

This file is a staging area to formalize the completed Riemann ξ function:
  ξ(s) = (1/2)·s·(1−s)·π^{−s/2}·Γ(s/2)·ζ(s)

Once complete and reviewed, move the content into `rh/academic_framework/` and
wire into the route.

/-- Skeleton: G(s) is nonzero on the open right half-plane Ω.
    Note: requires careful handling near s = 1 where ζ has a pole and the
    completed ξ cancels; the factor G alone may vanish at 0/1 but the product
    ξ is entire. This lemma will be refined or replaced in the final factoring
    argument to avoid relying on G ≠ 0 pointwise at s = 1. -/
lemma G_nonzero_on_Ω : ∀ s ∈ RH.RS.Ω, G s ≠ 0 := by
  -- TODO: use that Γ has no zeros, π ≠ 0, and restrict to a domain avoiding 0,1.
  -- Alternatively, avoid this lemma in the final route and argue directly with ξ.
  intro s hs;
  -- This version is refined below to exclude s = 1 explicitly.
  -- As stated, G 1 = 0 (since the factor (1 - s) vanishes), so this lemma
  -- cannot hold at s = 1. Use the away-from-one variant instead.
  have : s ≠ (1 : ℂ) := by
    -- In Ω we can have s = 1, so we cannot derive a contradiction.

/-- Refined: `G s ≠ 0` for `s ∈ Ω` with `s ≠ 1`.
    Proof: each factor is nonzero on Ω and `s ≠ 1` removes the zero of `(1 - s)`.
    We use that `s ≠ 0` for `Re s > 1/2`, `π ≠ 0`, `π ^ z ≠ 0`, and `Γ` has no
    zeros. -/
