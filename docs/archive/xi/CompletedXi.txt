Completed ξ (archive sketch)

1) Archimedean factor G(s):
   G(s) = (1/2)·s·(1−s)·π^{−s/2}·Γ(s/2).

2) Factorization on Ω = {Re s > 1/2}:
   ξ(s) := G(s)·ζ(s).
   Goal: Formalize as Lean theorem xi_factorization: riemannXi s = G s * riemannZeta s.

3) Symmetry (functional equation):
   ξ(s) = ξ(1−s) ⇒ zeros symmetric under s ↦ 1−s.
   Goal: Provide symXi: ∀ρ, ξ(ρ)=0 → ξ(1−ρ)=0.

4) RS Θ and assign data:
   Use existing RS/SchurGlobalization removable-set pinch; construct local assignment for each boundary point and propagate Schur to Ω.

Integration plan:
- Keep this under docs/archive/xi/ (not built) while drafting.
- Once ready, move definitions/proofs into rh/academic_framework and rh/RS, then use RH_riemannXi_from_RS_offZeros to close RH unconditionally.
