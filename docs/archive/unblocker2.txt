  RS: explicit Θ,N for the off-zeros ζ–Schur bridge, pinned limit, and boundary assignment.


  This file depends only on standard mathlib (complex analysis) and your RS interfaces:
  - IsSchurOn
  - riemannZeta, riemannXi
  - the “outer” ℰ(s) (written `O` below) and the 2-modified determinant det₂(I - A(s)), bundled here
    as functions with the properties listed in the hypotheses of `ofEqOffZeros`.
  - the completed-factor identity ξ = G · ζ on the right half-plane (meromorphic identity).


  The key identities match the manuscript:
    F := 2 J,   Θ := (F - 1)/(F + 1),   J = det₂ / (O · ξ),
    ξ = (2 det₂ / O) · (1 - Θ)/(1 + Θ)      (Cayley/involution algebra),
    ζ = ξ / G,
    hence off zeros of ζ:  ζ = Θ / N  with  N := Θ · G / ξ  (or equivalently
    N := (O·G/(2 det₂)) · Θ · (1+Θ)/(1-Θ) on Ω \ Z(ξ)).

  Inputs:
  * `det2, O, G` : the analytic factors from the manuscript;
    - `det2` is det₂(I - A(s)), analytic on Ω; nonvanishing on Ω.
    - `O` is the outer, analytic and nonvanishing on Ω.
    - `G` is the archimedean factor linking ξ and ζ (ξ = G·ζ) and meromorphic; on Ω it is analytic
      and nonvanishing away from its (harmless) zeros off the ζ-zeros. (Near s=1 it cancels ζ’s pole
      in ξ; we only use G on `Ω \ Z(ζ)`.)
  * `hJ` pins `J = det2/(O·ξ)` off the ξ-zeros.
  * `hξ_eq_Gζ` encodes the completed identity `ξ = G·ζ` on Ω.
  * `hSchurF` supplies the Schur bound for the Cayley transform Θ of F:=2J on Ω.
  * `hNonCancel` is the non‑cancellation at ξ‑zeros (det₂ and O are nonzero there).


  Output:
  * Θ := Cayley(2J),   N := Θ·G/ξ (manifestly analytic off Z(ξ));
  * ζ = Θ/N on `Ω \ Z(ζ)`,  N ≠ 0 there;
  * pinned limit `Θ → 1` at interior ξ‑zeros by Cayley + non‑cancellation.
