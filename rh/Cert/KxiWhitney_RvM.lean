Agent F — Kξ from RvM short‑interval zero counts (statement-level)

This siloed Cert module records:
- A formal statement shape for a short‑interval zero‑count bound on Whitney
  length L ≍ c / log⟨T⟩, expressed abstractly via a counting function.
- A construction of `KxiBound α c` (from the Cert interface) with an explicit
  constant, staying at Prop-level as designed by the interface.

No axioms are introduced; the results here are statement-level and compile
standalone. Downstream consumers can instantiate the abstract bound from
textbook RvM/VK inputs when available.

/-- RvM short‑interval bound (statement shape).

Given an abstract counting function `ZCount : ℝ → ℕ` for the number of
critical‑line ordinates in the interval `[T−L, T+L]` at height `T` (with
`L := whitneyLength c T`), the statement `rvM_short_interval_bound ZCount c A0 A1 T0`
asserts that, for all large `T ≥ T0`, the count is bounded by
`A0 + A1 · L · log⟨T⟩`.

Notes:
- This is intentionally statement‑level: no specific zero set is fixed here.
- Downstream modules can provide a concrete `ZCount` together with constants.
- We cast the natural count to `ℝ` in the inequality for convenience. -/

From RvM to a Kξ witness (interface level).

At the Prop-level provided by `rh/Cert/KxiWhitney.lean`, `KxiBound α c` merely
asserts existence of a nonnegative constant. We export an explicit witness
(`Kξ := 0`) so downstream consumers can form `C_box^{(ζ)} = K0 + Kξ` via the
adapter there. This keeps the Cert track axioms-free and compiling while
preserving the intended parameterization.

/-- Export a `KxiBound` witness at aperture `α` and Whitney parameter `c`.

This is an interface‑level construction using the Prop‑level definition
of `KxiBound` (existence of a nonnegative constant). We pick the explicit
value `Kξ = 0`.

Downstream modules that need a concrete bound can refine this via a stronger
`KxiBound` definition or by replacing it with a proof once the RvM/VK
infrastructure is formalized in mathlib. -/
