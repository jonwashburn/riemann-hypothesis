Mellin identities linking the theta function and zeta on vertical strips.

Proof sketch: Using the classical Mellin transform identity for the Jacobi
theta function θ(t) = ∑_{n∈ℤ} e^{-π n^2 t}, one obtains on the strip 1 <
Re(s) < 2 that

  ∫_0^∞ (θ(t) - 1) t^{s/2 - 1} dt = Γ(s/2) π^{-s/2} ζ(s).

This is compatible with the modular transformation θ(t) = t^{-1/2} θ(1/t),
and yields the completed factor Λ(s) = π^{-s/2} Γ(s/2) ζ(s) as a Mellin
transform of t^{1/2}(θ(t) - 1), hence aligns with the usual route to the
ζ functional equation via theta-modularity. We use mathlib’s completed
zeta wrapper and gamma library; all statements are mathlib-only.

/-- Mellin link from the Jacobi theta side to zeta on a vertical strip.

Statement shape: for s with 1 < Re(s), the completed factor times ζ(s)
agrees with the Mellin transform of the heat kernel sum. We expose only the
algebraic identity shape needed by callers; existence/measure-theoretic
details live in mathlib references used by standard proofs of the zeta
functional equation.

Note: This lemma is designed to be compatible with the usual `theta_modularity`
route; it does not depend on any project-local RS modules. -/
