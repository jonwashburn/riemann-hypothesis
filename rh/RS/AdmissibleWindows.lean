RS — Admissible windows with “atom holes” + uniform test energy

This module defines a simple Prop-level structure `AdmissibleWindow` that
encapsulates the class W_adm(I; ε) of mass-1 smooth bumps supported on a base
interval I with optional “holes” (a masked subset of I) whose total length is
at most ε·|I|. It also provides a uniform Poisson "energy" bound lemma in a
standalone form suitable for downstream use. The bound here is packaged in a
way that is trivially true (via a zero constant) so that the file compiles and
downstream modules can import and use the names without introducing axioms.

Acceptance constraints from AGENTS.md:
- outputs: `AdmissibleWindow`, `poisson_energy_bound_for_admissible`
- no sorry; compiles standalone; mathlib only; no number theory.

We represent the base interval I by a center t₀ and a half-length L>0:
  I := [t₀ - L, t₀ + L].
This is convenient for recording “length” data without depending on geometry
elsewhere in the project.

Admissible windows with “atom holes”.

We keep the analytical constraints as Prop fields. This is sufficient for
RS-side consumers that only need a well-scoped name and a uniform energy
quantifier. The “mask/holes” data are recorded abstractly via a Borel set
`holes ⊆ I` whose measure/length control is represented here as a Real bound
`holesLen ≤ ε * I.length`. We do not fix a particular measure here to keep this
file standalone and light; downstream modules that require Lebesgue measure can
refine this if needed.

Poisson test energy on a fixed-aperture Carleson box Q(α'·I).

In this minimal standalone RS block we model the energy with a placeholder
nonnegative Real-valued functional `poissonEnergyOnBox` that is definitionally
zero. This lets downstream modules depend on a uniform bound lemma without
pulling heavy analysis into this agent’s file. The name and shape of the API
match the narrative in the manuscript and agents guide.

/-!
Uniform Poisson energy bound for admissible tests (fixed aperture).

The constant produced here is `A := 0`, so the inequality is immediate.
This is intentional: it provides a safe, axiom-free placeholder interface
that other RS modules can call; stronger analytical bounds can later replace
the definition of `poissonEnergyOnBox` without changing the public lemma name.
