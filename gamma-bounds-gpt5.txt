  Uniform H′ strip bound for H(s) = π^{-s/2} Γ(s/2) on { s : σ0 ≤ Re s ≤ 1 } with 1/2 < σ0 ≤ 1.


  Strategy:
  * Fix r := σ0/2. For any s with σ0 ≤ Re s ≤ 1, the circle sphere s r lies in { Re ζ ≥ σ0/2 }.
  * On that circle, bound |π^{-(ζ/2)}| ≤ π^{-σ0/4} and |Γ(ζ/2)| ≤ 8/σ0.
  * Apply Cauchy derivative inequality: ‖H′(s)‖ ≤ (1/r) * sup_{|ζ−s|=r} ‖H(ζ)‖.
  * Conclude with C := (16 / σ0^2) * π^{-σ0/4}.
